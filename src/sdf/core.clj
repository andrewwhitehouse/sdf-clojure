;; The other aspect of this, is "advertising" the arity of a function. In Clojure this can be done

;; A key point seems to be that spread-combine doesn't have knowledge of how the functions are defined (thereby making it more flexible).
;; However it would be easy enough for the caller simply to specify the number of expected arguments. The key question
;; I have is how much benefit the arity restriction actually gives us above simply calling the functions and seeing
;; whether or not they behave as expected (with automated tests).
